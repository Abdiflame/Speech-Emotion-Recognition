Speech Emotion Recognition models implementation with TensorFlow and Keras

## Speech Emotion Recognition High-Competitive Models (2019-2020)

On this repository I share my studies and a simple implementation of speech emotion recognition models that reached a very high-competitive accuracy with the state-of-the-art papers available nowadays.

----------

### [Datasets]
I used IEMOCAP dataset for the Multimodal application
and RAVDESS dataset for the Audio only model application.

- RAVDESS Dataset can be found at: 
https://zenodo.org/record/1188976#.XiQ7NcgzaUk

- IEMOCAP Dataset can be found at:

### [Audio Features]
On both models, I used MFCC (n = 40) as audio input feature.
